// This file serves as a bridge to the auth-types.d.ts declaration file
// It allows imports like: import '../types/auth-types' to work correctly
// The actual type declarations are in auth-types.d.ts

// Re-export any types if needed
// This file intentionally left mostly empty as the .d.ts file contains ambient declarations
