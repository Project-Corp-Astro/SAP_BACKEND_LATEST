# Security Documentation

This section provides comprehensive information about the security measures, best practices, and guidelines implemented in the Corp Astro Super Admin Panel (SAP) backend.

## Contents

- [Security Overview](./overview.md) - High-level overview of security architecture
- [Authentication and Authorization](./auth.md) - Details about the authentication system
- [Data Protection](./data-protection.md) - Information about data security measures
- [Security Best Practices](./best-practices.md) - Guidelines for secure development

## Security Principles

The Corp Astro SAP security architecture is built on the following principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for users and processes
3. **Secure by Default**: Security enabled by default in all components
4. **Data Protection**: Protecting sensitive data at rest and in transit
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing security monitoring and alerting
6. **Regular Updates**: Keeping dependencies and systems up-to-date
7. **Security Testing**: Regular security testing and vulnerability scanning
