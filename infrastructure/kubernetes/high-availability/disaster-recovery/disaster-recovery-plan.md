# SAP Backend Disaster Recovery Plan
# Module 9: High Availability & Disaster Recovery
# Version: 1.0 | Date: 2025-07-13

## 🚨 DISASTER RECOVERY OBJECTIVES

### Recovery Targets
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 30 minutes
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 15 minutes  
- **Availability Target**: 99.9% (8.76 hours downtime/year)
- **Failover Time**: 30 seconds
- **Data Loss Tolerance**: < 15 minutes

## 🔄 DISASTER SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Complete Zone Failure
**Impact**: One availability zone becomes unavailable
**Recovery Action**: Automatic failover to remaining zones
**Expected Recovery Time**: 2-5 minutes

**Steps**:
1. Monitor detects zone failure
2. HPA redistributes traffic to healthy zones
3. Database failover to standby replicas
4. DNS updates point to healthy endpoints
5. Validate service functionality

### Scenario 2: Database Failure
**Impact**: Primary database becomes unavailable
**Recovery Action**: Promote standby replica to primary
**Expected Recovery Time**: 5-10 minutes

**Steps**:
1. Database monitoring detects primary failure
2. Automated failover promotes standby replica
3. Update connection strings to new primary
4. Restart application services if needed
5. Verify data consistency

### Scenario 3: Complete Region Failure
**Impact**: Entire AWS region becomes unavailable
**Recovery Action**: Manual failover to DR region
**Expected Recovery Time**: 20-30 minutes

**Steps**:
1. Activate DR region infrastructure
2. Restore latest database backup
3. Update DNS to point to DR region
4. Scale up services to handle full load
5. Notify stakeholders of DR activation

## 🛠️ AUTOMATED RECOVERY TOOLS

### Database Failover Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automated database failover
kubectl patch cluster postgres-ha-cluster -n sap-prod --type='merge' \
  -p='{"spec":{"switchover":{"targetPrimary":"postgres-ha-cluster-2"}}}'
```

### Service Health Check
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Comprehensive health check
kubectl get pods -n sap-prod --field-selector=status.phase!=Running
kubectl get services -n sap-prod
kubectl get ingress -n sap-prod
```

### Backup Verification
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Verify latest backup integrity
aws s3 ls s3://sap-backups/postgres/$(date +%Y/%m/%d)/ --recursive
```

## 📊 MONITORING AND ALERTING

### Critical Alerts
- Database connection failures > 5 seconds
- Pod failure rate > 10% in 5 minutes
- Response time > 1 second for 3 consecutive minutes
- Disk usage > 80%
- Memory usage > 85%

## 🧪 DISASTER RECOVERY TESTING

### Monthly DR Drill Schedule
- **Week 1**: Zone failure simulation
- **Week 2**: Database failover test  
- **Week 3**: Network partition test
- **Week 4**: Full DR region activation

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] RTO/RPO targets met
- [ ] Data integrity verified
