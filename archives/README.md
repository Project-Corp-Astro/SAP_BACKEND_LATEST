# üì¶ Project Archives

**Historical files and deprecated components**

This directory contains files that have been moved from the main project structure during reorganization. These files are preserved for historical reference and potential future use.

## üìÅ Contents

### Deprecated Files
Files that are no longer actively used but preserved for reference:
- Legacy configuration files
- Outdated scripts and utilities
- Previous version artifacts
- Experimental implementations

### Archive Policy

Files are archived here when they:
1. **No longer serve active purpose** in the current project structure
2. **May contain historical value** for understanding project evolution
3. **Could be useful for future reference** or troubleshooting
4. **Should not be deleted permanently** due to potential dependency

## üßπ Clean Archive

This archive is maintained as part of project organization:
- **Organized by date** when archived
- **Documented reason** for archival
- **Regular cleanup** of truly obsolete files
- **Searchable structure** for easy reference

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Files in this directory are not actively maintained**
- **Do not use archived files in production**

- **Archived files may contain outdated security practices**
